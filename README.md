## Setting up 
1. Setting up vscode to run jupyter notebooks : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1sAzPojKMg
2. Clone the repo
3. Run : pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Copy the url path to where the data is stored on your pc in the reading files cells of the notebook ....
   
> **Note**: If you move the data folder into the project ... please label the root folder as data so that the gitignore file does exactly that ... ignores it while pushing changes. Just trying to keep the repo light for guys who already have the data locally.

6. Run the notebook!
